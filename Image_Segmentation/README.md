## General instructions: 
   1. Run the first cell under installation to start installing the requirements and connect to a gpu.
   2. While that runs, drop the dataset.zip and annotions.json on the content section. If you dont have annotations or if you want to create new ones, the coco_format folder has notebook with instructions on how to crate annotations from binary masks.
