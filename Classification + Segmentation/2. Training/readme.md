# Overview

For training the clasification and segmentation model we used the annotated data from the previews step. 

## Segmentation 

For segmentation we used the Roboflow implementation of YOLOv8 on google colab, and modified for segmentation; we also added a section to continue the training since many times we were not able to finish it.
