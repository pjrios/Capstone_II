# Solar Panel Classification & Segmentation Pipeline
Given the residential building dataset, a trained binary solar panel classification model was employed to identify residential buildings with solar panels as the input for the following solar panel segmentation task, which processes the filtered images by counties to segment the section of images with solar panels. The generated outputs were solar panels statistics such as the number of houses with solar panels and the number of solar panel patches.
