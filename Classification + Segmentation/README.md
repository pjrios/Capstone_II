# Overview
The folder contains several notebooks for performing different tasks related to data annotation, segmentation, and classification. These tasks are organized in a sequence that starts with data annotation and progresses through segmentation and classification to ultimately enable predictions with the trained models.

## Annotations
The first folder “1. Annotations” contains information to allow you to annotate binary images or other types of images. These annotations serve as the foundation for the segmentation and classification models that will be trained later.
## Training
The second folder “2. Training” is dedicated to training the classification and segmentation models. These models use the annotations generated in the previous step for training. 
## Prediction
Finally, the last folder “3. Prediction” contains notebooks to allow you to use the trained segmentation and classification models to make predictions.
