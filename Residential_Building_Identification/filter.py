# This code will open the GeoJSON file, 
# read the contents into a Python object, 
# and then iterate through the features in the file.
# For each feature, it will extract the coordinates 
# and check if they fall within the specified bounding box. 
# If the coordinates are within the bounding box, the feature 
# is added to a list of filtered features. Finally, the code
# writes the filtered features to a new GeoJSON file.

# Note that this code assumes that the GeoJSON file 
# follows the standard format for a GeoJSON file, 
# with a top-level features property that contains 
# a list of feature objects. Each feature object 
# should have a geometry property that contains the 
# coordinates for the feature.
