    "\n",
    "Next, it iterates over the rows of the polygons_gdf GeoDataFrame and creates a list of Polygon objects called polygons. It does this by extracting the geometry of each row using the geometry attribute, and then creating a Polygon object using the shape function from shapely.\n",

    "It then iterates over the rows of the features_gdf GeoDataFrame and extracts the coordinates of each feature using the geometry attribute. It then checks if the coordinates are contained within any of the Polygon objects in the polygons list using the contains method from Shapely. If the coordinates are contained within a polygon, the feature is added to a list of filtered features called filtered_features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the code creates a new GeoDataFrame object called filtered_gdf using the GeoDataFrame constructor and the filtered_features list. It then saves the filtered_gdf to a new GeoJSON file called filtered.geojson using the to_file function.\n",

    "This code should filter the features in the Alaska.geojson file and create a new GeoJSON file called filtered.geojson with only the features that are contained within the polygons in the alaska-ra.geojson file"
