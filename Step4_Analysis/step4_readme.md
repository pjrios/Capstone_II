This file outlines the process of comparing the socio-demographic variables with the solar panel distribution.
We categorize the dataset into two categories:
  1.

The third column lists the number of solar patches (one house might have more than one solar patches). 
  Primary key is of the form <5-digit county FIPS code>-<6-digit census tract number>-<1-digit block group number>
